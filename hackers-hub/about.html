<h2 class="section-heading">About Yuvraj (Yuvi)</h2>
<p class="text-muted">I am <strong>Yuvraj Goapbhai Barot</strong>, a 20-year-old student from India pursuing a B.E. in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I blend rigorous academic learning with hands-on cybersecurity practice. My work focuses on ethical hacking, defensive techniques, and exploring how AI/ML can improve digital security.</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">What drives me</h3>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity to dissect systems and understand how they fail.</li>
<li>A passion for building defensive tools and clear, reproducible tutorials for learners.</li>
<li>Belief in responsible, ethical security research and community knowledge sharing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mt-3">Skills & Interests</h3>
<p class="text-muted">Networking fundamentals, penetration testing workflows, Linux internals, basic reverse engineering, and applied AI for security tasks. I enjoy building labs, automating boring tasks, and explaining complex topics simply.</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">What you’ll find here</h3>
<p>Practical guides, tool writeups, lab exercises, and curated resources for beginners and intermediate learners. This site documents what I learn and experiments I do in my lab—shared so others can climb the same ladder faster and safer.</p>
