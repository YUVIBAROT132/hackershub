<h1>Networking for Cybersecurity</h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Networking is the backbone of both attacks and defense. Understanding TCP/IP, routing, subnets, ARP, DNS, and common services will make you a better defender and tester.</p>
<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
<li>OSI vs TCP/IP models — map services to layers</li>
<li>IP addressing, subnets, CIDR — host discovery and segmentation</li>
<li>Ports and services — common ports (22,80,443,445,3389)</li>
<li>DNS fundamentals — lookups, zone transfers, poisoning risks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommended commands</h3>
<pre>
# discover local hosts
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# check routing table
ip route show

# ARP table
arp -n
</pre>
<p><em>Defensive tip:</em> monitor abnormal DNS queries and unusual outbound connections; these are common signs of compromise.</p>
